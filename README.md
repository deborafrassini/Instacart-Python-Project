# Instacart-Python-Project
This folder is to showcase Python Skills for Data Analysis.

In this project, it was used Python to: 
1- Combine data tables, 
2- Manipulate data sets, 
3- Change data types, 
4- Clean the combined data, 
5- Create visualization.

The project requested to document all the actions taken in each of the

by Carrer Foundry and can be ficticious.
