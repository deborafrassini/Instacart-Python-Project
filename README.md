# Instacart-Python-Project
This folder is to showcase Python Skills for Data Analysis.

In this project, it was used Python to: 
1. Combine dataframes
2. Perform data consistency
3. Perform data wrangling
4. Perform data analysis
5. Create visualization

# Introduction
Youâ€™re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to

to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.
 
# Dataframes used
* Customers;
* Orders;
* Orders_products_prior;
* Products;
* Departments.

# Folders

The project files are stored in following folder structure:

* 01 Project Management: Project brief
* 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data which contain the original data frames and Prepared Data contain the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
* 03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
* 04 Analysis: The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
* 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel

# Tools:
Jupiter Notebook.
Libraries used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* OS
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* SciPy


# Note: 
Even though Instacart is a real company, the data was provided and fabricated
by Carrer Foundry and are ficticious and for practice only.
